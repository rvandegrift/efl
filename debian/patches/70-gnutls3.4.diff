Description: Fix build with gnutls 3.4
 gnutls_pubkey_get_verify_algorithm and gnutls_pubkey_verify_hash no longer
 exist in gnutls 3.4. See 
 http://www.gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Upgrading-from-previous-versions.html
 
 The results of the call to gnutls_pubkey_get_verify_algorithm are discarded, 
 the code only checks if it succeeds or not. I guess it was intended as some 
 sort of sanity check. I replaced it with a call to 
 gnutls_x509_crt_get_signature_algorithm
 
 I replaced the call to gnutls_pubkey_verify_hash with a call to
 gnutls_pubkey_verify_hash2 filling in the new "algo" parameter with the result
 of gnutls_x509_crt_get_signature_algorithm
 
 The code now compiles and I don't think it's any more broken than it was
 before but I have concerns about the code in general. It seems to have an
 implicit assuption that the certificate signature algorithm will be sha1.

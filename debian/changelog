efl (1.8.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * debian/control: Build-Depend on libudev-dev only for Linux architectures
  * debian/control: libevas1 Depends: libevas-loaders to support more formats
  * debian/control: drop B-D on librsvg2-dev, svg is handled via evas-loaders
  * debian/control: use Architecture: linux-any instead of hardcoded list
  * debian/control: mark libeet1 and libevas1 packages as Multi-Arch: same
  * debian/control: bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5, no changes required
  * patches/03_ecore_evas_extn_abi: remove, applied upstream
  * patches/03_no_ecore_audio_test: disable the Ecore_Audio testsuite.
    We don't ship libecore-audio but the testsuite seems to have issues at
    least on s390x. Since the library has other problems that make
    debugging difficult, disable the tests until it gets fixed.
  * patches/04_eina_file_hash_fix: cherry-pick cad0db51 to fix FTBFS on Sparc
  * debian/rules: use a large testsuite timeout to fix issues on slow buildds
  * debian: merge all libe*-doc into a single efl-doc package.
    The initial upload erroenously copied the complete doc in all the -doc
    packages, reuslting in much bigger packages than expected. Now that all
    libs are in the same source package, keeping separate -doc binary
    packages does not make much sense, so merge them all.

efl (1.8.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First upload of the merged EFL tree (Closes: #729751)
  * debian: add control and packages information from previous EFL packages
  * debian: bring back and refresh applicable patches from previous EFL packages
  * debian: move to a single debug symbols package for EFL
  * debian: core evas engines now ship with libevas1, drop libevas-engines-core
  * debian: upstream no longer provides static libraries
  * debian: fix install path for ecore and edje utility libraries
  * debian: remove evas loaders install; they'll be split in a separate package
  * debian: update Build-Depends as per new EFL requirements
  * debian/rules: always run autoreconf during build to get a recent version
  * debian/rules: force build with dev profile
  * debian/rules: add support for parallel builds
  * debian: add packaging information for EO.
    Since this a base EFL that all other libs depend on, integrate it with
    the eina package
  * debian: add packaging information for Eldbus.
    To avoid a circular dependency between eldbus and ecore (ecore modules
    depend on eldbus, eldbus depends on ecore), put the eldbus library in
    the libecore package
  * debian: refactor packages dependencies to be easier to maintain.
    Upstream always generates the .pc files to have dependencies between
    libs with the upstream version (ie. for EFL 1.8.3 all .pc files refer to
    1.8.3), so there's no point in trying to be clever: just use the
    source:Upstream-Version. Also, include Efl_Config.h in eina and make
    sure all -dev packages depend on libeina-dev to get that config header
  * debian/libevas1.symbols: mark all evas_common symbols as optional.
    Even if the evas_common symbols are exported, they are internal to
    Evas: they are only part of the internal engine API, but the symbols
    have to be exported because Evas module use them and we need to be able
    to resolve references to those symbols
  * debian/libecore-evas1.symbols: drop windows-only symbol removed from EFL 1.8
  * add patches/03_ecore_evas_extn_abi: cherry-pick e1b1296 to fix ABI issue
  * debian: add new symbols from this version in the symbols files
  * debian: add a DEP5-compliant copyright file

 Embryo is primarily a shared library that gives you an API to load

 bytecode that it understands.  This abstract (or virtual) machine is
 similar to a real machine with a CPU, but it is emulated in
 software.  The architecture is simple and is the same as the
 abstract machine (AMX) in the SMALL language as it is based on
 exactly the same code. Embryo has modified the code for the AMX
 extensively and has made it smaller and more portable.  It is VERY
 small.  The total size of the virtual machine code AND header files
 is less than 2500 lines of code.  It includes the floating point
 library support by default as well.  This makes it one of the
 smallest interpreters around, and thus makes is very efficient to
 use in code.

Description: Library for manipulating devices through udev
 This library is part of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). It
 interfaces directly with libudev, avoiding such middleman daemons as
 udisks/upower or hal, and gathers device information when it becomes
 known to the system. This can be used to determine such things as:
  - If a cdrom has a disk inserted
  - The temperature of a cpu core
  - The remaining power left in a battery
  - The current power consumption of various parts
  - Monitor in realtime the status of peripheral devices

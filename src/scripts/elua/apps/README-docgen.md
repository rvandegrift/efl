# docgen

This is the upcoming documentation generator for EFL. It takes documentation
described in Eo files and turns it into a DokuWiki structure (with possibility
of adapting it to other systems later on).

Use the supplied build.sh script to generate. By default, it assumes that a
directory called "dokuwiki" is present in the current directory, so symlink
your dokuwiki setup into it (or change the path).

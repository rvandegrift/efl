         [[The dimensions of this object's viewport.

           This property represents the size of an image (file on disk,
           vector graphics, GL or 3D scene, ...) view: this is the logical
           size of a view, not the number of pixels in the buffer, nor its
           visible size on the window.

           For scalable scenes (vector graphics, 3D or GL), this means scaling
           the contents of the scene and drawing more pixels as a result; For
           pixmaps this means zooming and stretching up or down the backing
           buffer to fit this view.

           In most cases the view should have the same dimensions as the
           object on the canvas, for best quality.

           @.view_size.set may not be implemented. If it is, it might trigger
           a complete recalculation of the scene, or reload of the pixel data.

           Refer to each implementing class specific documentation for more
           details.

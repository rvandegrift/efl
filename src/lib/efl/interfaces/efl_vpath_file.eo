   [[ VPath File is an actual representation of a downloaded/mapped vpath file

      Keep this object around for as long as you need to use the file as it
      may have been downloaded and kept as a local temporary file and
      deletion may remove it.

      When you have a Vpath File object for the first time, call the do()
      method on it to actually begin/do the mapping. From here the
      fetched or failed event callbacks will be called, inside of which or
      afterwards you can fetch the resulting local file path by getting the
      result property.

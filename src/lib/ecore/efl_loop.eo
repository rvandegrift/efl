   [[The Efl Main Loop

   Efl main loop provide a clean and tiny event loop library with many modules to
   do lots of convenient things for a programmer, to save time and effort. It's
   small and lean, designed to work from embedded systems all the way up to large
   and powerful multi-cpu workstations. The main loop has a number of primitives to
   be used with its main loop. It serializes all the primitives and allows for
   great responsiveness without the need for threads (or any other concurrency), but
   provide them if you need to.

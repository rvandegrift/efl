    [[The basic socket interface.

      It is built upon the three core Input/Output interfaces:
        - @Efl.Io.Reader: to receive data.
        - @Efl.Io.Writer: to send data.
        - @Efl.Io.Closer: to close the socket for further operations.

      Thus it can be used with utilities like @Efl.Io.Copier.

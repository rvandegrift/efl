              This method allows a server to use an existing socket
              received from systemd or similar system.

              It will replace @Efl.Net.Server.serve, thus if this is
              used, that method will return EALREADY.

              \@note The parameter 'address' given to this function is
              only used to validate the next socket available, it
              doesn't search for a socket with the given address. Thus
              the socket to be used is the next unused and orders
              matter is using multiple servers!

              \@note subclasses must validate the socket and return
              EINVAL prior to call the base class with
              Efl.Object.super. They must also emit "serving" when
              ready, for instance stream protocols may need to check
              for listening and if not try to listen. Usually they
              will also query getsockname() and set
              @Efl.Net.Server.address.

              Errors:

                - EALREADY: already have a socket, either from
                  previous @.socket_activate or
                  @Efl.Net.Server.serve. Usually represents a
                  programming error.

                - ENOENT: no sockets received from process manager
                  (ie: systemd). Usually this is not a fatal error,
                  just proceed by calling @Efl.Net.Server.serve

                - EINVAL: the socket received is not of the correct
                  family, type or protocol. Usually this means a
                  configuration mismatch with the order of server
                  creation and calls to socket_activate. The
                  systemd.socket entries must match the order in your
                  application.
